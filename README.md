# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
This project uses data provided by usgs.gov to show a visual repersentation of all of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plate's location. This project was created using Javascript's leaflet and d3 libraries, mapbox's api, and geoJson data from usgs.gov. The final product is in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.
